          Hi, I'm Aditya! I'm a second-year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate based in Bangalore.<br /> 
          I'm super passionate about creating things on the web. I have a solid grasp of frontend development<br />
          and am actively expanding my backend skills. UX design is close to my heart because I believe that<br />
          great user experiences can make a significant difference.<br />
          <br />
          I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects and collaborations that can help me grow as a developer.<br />
          Currently, I'm working on an exciting open-source project, Lamp, which aims to<br />
          simplify the process of creating and managing web applications.<br />
          <br />
          Feel free to reach outâ€”my DMs are always open to discuss code, cricket, Formula 1, and Harry Potter!
